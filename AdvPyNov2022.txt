  ===============

 28 Nov - 1 Dec 2022
    Toby Dussek


9:30 start
11:00 coffee
12:30 lunch
3:00 tea
4:30 end

- you will need: a copy of Python 3.x (real or virtual)
- an editor: VS Code, PyCharm, Spyder etc...
- internet, able to install python libraries (e.g. requests library)

Python code lives in classes (or in functions), in modules, which live in packages (folders)

Monday
> intro and welcome
  - what do you currently know
  - what do you want to know
> classes 
> abstract and concrete classes
> name mangled members
> if __name__== '__main__': revisited
> using decorators
> functional programming: map, filter and reduce
> Loading local and remote data (requests)
> after lunch review
> instrinsics
> comprehensions, generators and yield

Tuesday
- passing headers etc. to a post method or requests
  see https://www.programcreek.com/python/example/6251/requests.post
> functional programming: parameters
> processing text/json
  - json.loads() takes JSON and returns Python structure
  - json.dumps() takes Python structure and returns JSON
> persisting files: read/write/append/exclusive/overwrite, text, bytes, json
> databases
  see https://wiki.python.org/moin/DatabaseProgramming
> other db connections
> Create, Read and Update (and DELETE) - CRUD operations
> populate db with sample data
> read and nicely format values from the db
> explore 'typicode' API as a static data source for JSON
> after lunch review exercise until 3:30 
  ask questions, help each other, share code (screen-share)
> we will be using the 'requests' library on Wednesday 
  (you may come across the urllib.requests which is the old-skool way of doing things)

Wednesday
> context manager - switch context e.g. for handling data input and output
> networking server/client (microservices)
> overview of Flask
> Testing: 
  - doctest revisited
  see https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html
  > unittest
> after lunch lab exercise
> pytest see https://docs.pytest.org/

we are on lunch break until 1:30

Thursday
> profiling: timings etc. (cprofile)
- multithreading, also limits of mutlithreading concurrency
- the global Interpreter Lock (GIL) will affect threading performance
- q how can we join many threads...
- Python has -u to unbuffer the output
- Python has -O to optimize code (especially usefull for threading)
- after lunch lab exercise
- logging - context mgr
- iterators __iter__
> named tuple
> zip
- deque, defaultdict etc
- q can we tell the queue to end by passing something? pass None then conditional
- end of course feedback
